# Genetic Algorithms in Travelling Salesman Problem

As a part of my Bachelor's thesis, I made a simulation for doing TSP with Genetic Algorithms. Feel free to use and improve!

![Overview of the simulation](https://github.com/hakosaj/KandiTSP/simulation.PNG)]("Overview")




## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository to a directory, compile and we are good to go! Makefile still needs to be done. 

### Prerequisites


-Windows 10! (Sorry, the current version is built around Windows libraries)

-SFML, at least version 2.5.1.


## Using the software

Compile all the files with g++, using compiler flags:
-fopenmp
-Wall
-O3
-march=native


Then simply run the file, the software tells you what to do!

In order to use further instances, those can be downloaded here for example: https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/

Make sure to format them to csv, same format as the other files!
