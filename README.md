# Genetic Algorithms in Travelling Salesman Problem

As a part of my Bachelor's thesis, I made a simulation for doing TSP with Genetic Algorithms. Feel free to use and improve!

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository to a directory, compile and we are good to go! Makefile still needs to be done. 

### Prerequisites
